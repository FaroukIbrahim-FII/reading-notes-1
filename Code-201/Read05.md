## Images :
### why images are used in websites, perhaps the website logo or a picture expressing an explanation or using pictures to avoid explanation in words. 

### When adding an image to the project, many things must be taken into account in order to get the best result, first that it has a direct relationship to our page and secondly, choosing appropriate colors with the page and thirdly that it be clear to the user. And it is better to create a special image file and name it img, and then divide special files for each group of images inside it.
### The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

#### Ex of img tag : `<img src="url" alt="alternatetext" width=".." height=".." >`
* src - Specifies the path to the image.
* alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image.
* title - add this to give title to the image.

### Three rules of putting image inside the website:
* Save images in the right format.
* Save images at the right size.
* Use the correct resolution.

#### There are several ways to modify images and add some effects to make it better for sure, for example we have the adope photoshop program, make sure to make your image as appropriate as possible in all aspects of the size and shape before you put it on your page.

* `<figure>` tag : specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings.
