# Growth Mindset :

#### The growth mindset is way to think in better to do all effort you need to be successful and facing the challenges and to stop fornt of obstcals ,stop compare yourslef to other people just focus on your life try to do best keep postive ideas in your mind , when we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better.

#### As in the nature of the situation, our mind is a muscle, like any muscle in the body, the more we learn, our minds become stronger and the expansion of perception increases.

#### You have to be strict about your own skills such as: Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset.

#### You may face some challenges such as:
 * obstacles
 * effort
 * criticism 
 * success of others 

##### Do not give up and persevere to succeed and reach the goal that is growth mindset.

#### In the end, do not be lazy and of the people whose cravings lead to comfort. Only take action now before you regret the time you wasted.

# Growth Mindset In my opinion :

* **I look to be a successful person in any field. I look forward to entering into all scientific or life matters.**

* **Looking at how much current technology is in the public domain and loving to immerse yourself in it and learn it for the sake of new knowledge and experience.**

* **One of the most beautiful things is to be a positive person with everyone and motivate them to progress and continue to perform the best. This will return you with satisfaction with yourself and feeling the extent of your positive impact.**
